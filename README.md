# Task-4: Application-Level Keyboard Input Logger

## Description
This project is part of **Task-4** and demonstrates keyboard event handling and file logging using Python.  
The application records keystrokes **only within its own graphical interface** and saves them to a text file with timestamps.

The project is implemented in a controlled and ethical manner with full user awareness.
